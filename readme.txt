my program is a user-computer guessing number game. the computer will generate a random animal and ask the user to guess it. the user has endless chances to guess the right animal. if the animals name was longer the computer will ask the user to type alonger name, ans same if it was shoeter. if the animal wwas not from the list it will ask the user to try again untill the user input the right answer.
